# Learn scrum

In this learning we will see what is <b>Agile Development</b>. Also, We'll see in detail how to manage a project using the Scrum techique which is a form or the flavor of Agile.

## What is Agile Development?

Agile is a different approach to software development which replaces the old school Waterfall software development process.

In Waterfall model one would consider the whole project at the beginning and do the following step by step: Define/Analyse, Build and release.
Each of these steps should be completely done before proceeding to the next stage. But the problem with this process and the model is that when a change happens at the middle of the project then you will face huge problems, as you didn't have any plans for it!

In Agile development you first define different pieces for your project and then do all the steps mentioned in the Waterfall process for each piece.
Agile methods use an iterative approach to a project with tight feedback loops that enable rapid adaptation when a new information or requirement for the project becomes available.

<b>In simple terms, you are agile!</b> And instead of predicting the whole project requirements right at the beginning, like how you do it in the Waterfall process, you are an adapter and accept the fact that change may happen! So as an adapter you adapt yourself along the way as the project is moving forward.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is one of the most and widely followed Agile techniques.

### Why do we need scrum?

First let's just mention some of the problems that the traditional Waterfall project development process has:

<ul>
    <li><b>Teams work completely independent from each other</b> and each sub-team completes its own activities before the other one starts its own. So what is the problem? An issue on one team, blocks the whole production line!</li>
    <li><b>Everything is decided up-front!</b> So what is the problem? Well, although the client has mentioned what she needs at the beginning of the project, but in reality what she wants may change over the course of the project, and it's not her fault! It's just how the things are... No one can completely predict the project requirements and insist on that! Things may change and new decisions must be made.</li>
    <li><b>Weak estimations!</b> As the tasks increase, the accuracy of how long each task takes decreases... Because unforeseen issues always arise, like bugs or client requirement changes</li>
</ul>

The scrum tried resolving the above mentioned problems:
<ul>
    <li>Inspecting the project's progress</li>
    <li>Evaluating the project's progress</li>
    <li>Adapting to the requirement of the project's in the pathway </li>
    <li>More importantly, the transparency is maintained through out the project </li>
</ul>
